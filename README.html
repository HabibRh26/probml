<h1>Practical report for LE49: Probabilistic Machine Learning</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/LE49/"><em>LE49 Probabilistic Machine Learning</em></a>
is a course taken by Part III and ACS students. Lectures are delivered by Prof Carl Rasmussen in the Engineering department.
The course is also taken by engineering students, as <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/4f13/1718/">Engineering Course 4f13</a>.</p>
<p>Assessment for <em>LE49 Probabilistic Machine Learning</em> consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>a practical report, worth 20%</li>
<li>a mini-project, worth 80%</li>
</ul>
<p>This library contains the three pieces of coursework that make up the practical report.
They are adapted from Prof Rasmussen's material.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="coursework1.ipynb">Coursework 1: Guassian processes</a></li>
<li><a href="coursework2.ipynb">Coursework 2: probabilistic ranking</a></li>
<li>Coursework 3: latent Dirichlet allocation (not yet released)</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission instructions are given on Moodle.</p>


<h3>What to submit</h3>

<p>Your answers should contain an explanation of what you do, and
2&ndash;4 central commands to achieve it. Complete listings are
unnecessary. The focus of your answer should be
<em>interpretation</em>: explain what the numerical values and graphs
you produce <em>mean</em>, and why they are as they are.  The text of
your answer to each question should be no more than a paragraph or
two.
</p>

<h3>Programming background</h3>

<p>You are expected to have a general understanding of how to program
in Python, including <code>numpy</code> and basic plotting with
<code>matplotlib</code>. There are many tutorials to be found
online. Alternatively, you may find it helpful to read the
<strong>DRAFT</strong> course notes for <em>IA Scientific
Computing</em>:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Jupyter notebooks on Azure</h3>

<p>These pieces of coursework is presented as <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>.
Jupyter notebooks are "live documents" that intersperse text and running code.
They have become the de facto form of data science communication inside companies like Google.
We will be using Jupyter hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing environment.
You can access it from any device &mdash; all you need is a web browser.</p>

<p>Click on 
<span style="border: solid black 1px">
<img src="res/clone-icon-fa.png" 
style="display:inline-block; padding:1pt">
Clone</span> at the top of the page to get your own runnable version of the 
Library (consisting of all notebooks for this course).
If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in: type in your Cambridge University CRSid e.g. <code>spqr1@cam.ac.uk</code>, and you should automatically be redirected to a Raven login page. 
Experiment freely with your clone of the library &mdash; you can always go back and read the <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/djw1005/libraries/probml">master version</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>For academic staff at Cambridge: if your Raven password
doesn't work, then you need to <a
href="https://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/ees/ees-sign-up/ees-enable-account">activate
your Microsoft account</a> first. For non-Cambridge users: you can sign up for
a free Microsoft account on the login page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you are logged in you can also create your own libraries and
notebooks, using the <code>Libraries</code> link at the top left at <a
href="https://notebooks.azure.com/">https://notebooks.azure.com/</a>. When
you create a notebook you will be asked which language to use. These pieces of coursework
use Python 3.6, which is substantially different to Python
2.7, so be alert when you look for help online.</p>

<p>These notebooks are hosted on the cloud, and the first lesson of
cloud computing is that <strong>the cloud will fail when you need it
most.</strong> Take regular backups, by going to the
<code>Libraries</code> page, clicking on the library, clicking on the
line with the relevant notebook, then clicking on <span style="border:
solid black 1px;"><img src="res/download.png" style="height:1em;
display:inline-block; padding:1pt; padding-right:3pt">Download</span>.
You can also run the notebooks on your own machine: follow the <a
href="http://jupyter.org/install.html">Jupyter installation
instructions</a>, and clone the notebooks from their <a
href="https://github.com/damonjw/probml">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
